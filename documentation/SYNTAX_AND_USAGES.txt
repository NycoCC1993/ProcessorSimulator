--SYNTAX--
Instruction Format:
  All instructions will contain the operation and parentheses, and every line in the file must end with ';'
    Example - ADDI (1 0 1);
              ; This line can be empty of code, but it must still have the semicolon
              XHALT (); Code beyond a ';' on a line will not be read, thus can be used for comments

  Instructions should have space separated, but NOT comma separated values
    Example - ADDI (1 0 1); This is proper code
              ADDI (1, 0, 1); This line will produce an error
