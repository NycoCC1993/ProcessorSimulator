"Monotonoj System"
--
Thank you for considering the Monotonoj System. This is a project in-progress which is inspired by the NIOS II processor
and is meant to be able to satisfy simple coding protocols similarly to the "Human Resource Machine" game.

One can view the current instruction set in src/Instructionset file, and the intended plans. Instructions are given more
detail in documentation/OPERATIONS.txt.
